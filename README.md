## Key Features

1. Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset containing labeled spam and non-spam emails.
2. Pre-processing: Clean and prepare the data by handling noise and missing values to ensure high-quality input.
3. Feature Selection: Utilize the Best First Feature Selection algorithm to identify the most relevant features for classification.
4. Model Training and Testing: Split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets to evaluate model performance.
5. Prediction and Evaluation: Generate predictions using the trained model and assess accuracy through confusion matrices and accuracy metrics.
6. Algorithm Comparison: Analyze and compare the performance of different classification algorithms to determine the most effective approach.
